# InstaGallery

InstaGallery is a simple web app, inspired by similar apps such as Instagram, that offers uploading of photos, displaying of uploaded photos in a grid gallery format and filtering of uploaded photos.

This is a very early beta version of InstaGallery which means that only basic functionality has been added and there is also a known bug that the developer team is working to solve for future versions. More features are also planned for future releases:

## Features to be added in future versions

* User login and registration.
* Persistence - storing of the photos that have been added to the app for rerendering next time the app is opened.
* Delete functionality - deleting photos from the app.
* Commenting on photos and viewing other users photo galleries.
* AI photo editing assistant (for pro photo editing tips).
* Displaying of the filtered photo in the photo gallery (in this early version the filtered photo is displayed in the editor modal).
* Save functionality - drawing of filtered photos to a canvas element, which will enable saving of edited photo.
* Improved UX/UI-design.

### Testing

InstaGallery has been tested using manual testing of some common use cases and edge cases. Will also be user tested before release.

### Bugs

Photos are displayed in a scattered pattern in the grid gallery.
