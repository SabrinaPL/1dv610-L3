# InstaGallery

InstaGallery is a simple to use web app for all your photo needs, inspired by similar apps such as Instagram, that offers uploading of photos, displaying of uploaded photos in a grid gallery format in alphabetical order and filtering of uploaded photos.

This is an early beta version of InstaGallery which means that only basic functionality has been added and there are also known bugs that the developer team is working to solve for future versions. More features are also planned for future releases.

## Features to be added in future versions

* User login and registration.
* Storing of your photos so you won't have to reupload them next time you use the app.
* Saving your edited photos.
* Deleting of photos that you no longer wish to keep.
* Commenting on photos and viewing other users photo galleries.
* AI photo editing assistant always at the ready (to give pro photo editing tips).
* Improved design and user experience.
* Mobile app version.

### Testing

InstaGallery has been tested by our developer team but we welcome all user feedback.

### Bugs

* Photos are displayed in a scattered pattern in the grid gallery.
* Adding filters to multiple photos affects the other photos in the gallery aswell (filters are added to all photos).

We are aware of these bugs and are working to solve them but if you find anything that doesn't work as expected.

### Feedback

We welcome feedback from our users, if you have any functionality that you wish us to implement in the future or if you have any feedback regarding the user experience, please reach out to the developer team via the following e-mail: <sp223kz@student.lnu.se>
